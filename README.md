### Binary Trees
Binary trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. <strong> Ensure to free memory appropriately using the free() function. </strong>

### Doubly Linked List
Doubly linked lists are linear data structures where elements are linked using pointers that contain references to the previous and next elements. This data structure is linked list-based. <strong> Ensure to free memory appropriately using the free() function. </strong>

### Hash Tables
Hash tables are data structures that implement associative arrays or mappings of key-value pairs. <strong> Ensure to free memory appropriately using the free() function. </strong>

### Queue (Array-Based)
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Queue (Linked List-Based)
Similar to the array-based queue, but implemented using a linked list instead of an array. This data structure is linked list-based. <strong> Ensure to free memory appropriately using the free() function. </strong>

### Singly Linked List
Singly linked lists are linear data structures where elements are linked using pointers that contain references to the next element. This data structure is linked list-based. <strong> Ensure to free memory appropriately using the free() function. </strong>

### Stack (Array-Based)
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

### Stack (Linked List-Based)
Similar to the array-based stack, but implemented using a linked list instead of an array. This data structure is linked list-based. <strong> Ensure to free memory appropriately using the free() function. </strong>

> This section emphasizes the importance of freeing memory appropriately for linked list-based data structures and mentions the use of <strong> [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) </strong> for testing memory leaks.
